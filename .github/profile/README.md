## AMOS

**Open-source analytics model stack for private equity, venture capital, and private markets.**

Private markets teams often live with different versions of the truth—numbers vary between CRM exports, fund admin portals, portfolio systems, and spreadsheets. AMOS gives you one consistent foundation for performance, exposure, and operations so investment, finance, and operations teams work from the same numbers. Ship dashboards faster, close the books with fewer surprises, and power AI assistants on trusted tables.

## Why AMOS

- **One source of truth**: standardized entities and definitions across funds, portfolios, deals, and entities
- **Faster time-to-insight**: prebuilt pipelines and patterns so you can focus on decisions, not plumbing
- **Cloud-agnostic**: works with modern warehouses and your preferred BI/AI tools
